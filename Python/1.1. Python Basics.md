#### Output
---
syntax - rule of programming language
syntax : print(object=' ',sep=' ' end' ')
sep - separator /to separate 
end - end /to write the end 
\n - new line
\t - tab space

#### Print
----
On Python To display the out put we use print code

```
Print()
```

#### Comment
----
Comment is simple notes that help us to remember the function of the code. 
Comment won't be executed.

``` 
we use some Symbol for comment
For single comment - # 
For multiple comment - ''' end ''' 
```

#### Python keywords
-----
#Keywords are word that are used by python programming sw that user can't use as variable.

```
False         await            else            import             pass
None         break                    
True         class    
and
as
assert
async
```

#### Variable
-----
- container used to store value.
#Var-declaration is a process of giving value to the word. The word that hold the data called #identifier.
- On Python Var declared when we assign the value.
- When we write the note we have to cover by quote. 

```
Gtst = 10 (int)
print("you are" , Gtst , "years old")

output...
you are 10 years old
```

#### Datatype
----
#Datatype type of data w/c stored in the computer.
- There are a lots of datatype 
```
Datatype                      class            

Numeric                    int,float,complex
Strig                        str
sequence                   list,tupl,range 
mapping                    dict
boolean                     bool
set                          set,frozenset 

```

##### a. Numeric Datatype
------
There are 3 known numeric datatype.
1. integer(int) - w/c holds integer number.
2. Float(float) - w/c holds decimal number.
3. Complex - hold complex number (i & j)

##### B. String data
----
String is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes.

##### c. Sequence Data
1. List
---
- ordered collection used to list different or similar type of item separated by comma and enclosed with in brackets.
- To access the item we use index(0,1,2...)
- also we can append item if we want.
```
To list
 languages = ["swift", "java", python"]
   print (languages)

output...

To access
 print(languages[0,1,2]) 
   0 - swift
   1 - java
   2 - python

output...

To Append 
 Languages.append("amharic")
  print (languages)

output...
```


2. Tuple
----
- Tuple is an ordered sequence item same as the list. the only difference is can't be modified.(immutable)
- we use parentheses to store item 
- and we use index to access item
```
To tuple
 Product = ("Microsoft", "xbox", 499.99")
   print (product)

output...

To access
 print(product(0,1,2)) 
   0 - Microsoft
   1 - xbox
   2 - 499.99

output...
```

3. Dictionary data
---
- Python directory is unordered collection of items. 
- it stores elements in key / value pairs
```
User1= {'user':'nathan26,'password':'p@$$word'}
- username and password = key
- nathan26 & p@$$word = value (w/c written after :) 
```
- we also use the Key as index to retrieve the value
```
capital_city = {'ethiopia':'adisabeba','italy':'rome','england':'london'}

 print(capital_city[ethiopia]) = adisabeba
 
 print(capital_city[england]) = London

```
